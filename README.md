Developing an advanced object detection model for e-commerce and retail applications. The challenge involves recognizing products in user-generated images with specified bounding boxes and accurately matching them with corresponding products in seller photos. The objective is to create an algorithm that seamlessly identifies and aligns products in seller photos with diverse user-generated search queries, considering two types of images: real-world user photos and carefully composed seller photos. The key focus is on accurate product identification, localization, and matching within these two distinct image categories.

## Step Involve:
You Only Look Once (YOLO) :YOLO stands for You Only Look Once, and true to its name, the 
algorithm processes a frame only once using a fixed grid size and then determines whether a 
grid box contains an image or not. For this purpose, the object detection algorithm uses a 
confidence metric and multiple bounding boxes within each grid box. However, it does not go 
into the complexities of multiple aspect ratios or feature maps, and thus, while this produces 
results faster, they may be somewhat less accurate than SSD.

### Step 1): 
To get your computer set up to perform python image recognition tasks, you need 
to download Python and install the packages needed to run image recognition jobs, including 
Keras.

### Step 2):
Keras is a high-level deep learning API for running AI applications. It runs on 
TensorFlow/Python and helps end-users deploy machine learning and AI applications using 
easy-to-understand code.

### Step 3): 
If your machine does not have a graphics card, you can use free GPU instances online 
on Google Colab. For the purpose of classifying animals, there is a well-labeled dataset known 
as “Animals-10” that you can find on Kaggle. The dataset is totally free to download.

### Step 4): 
Once you have obtained the online dataset from Kaggle by getting an API token, you 
can then start coding in Python after reuploading the necessary files to Google Drive. For more 
details on platform-specific implementations, several well-written articles on the internet 
take you step-by-step through the process of setting up an environment for AI on your 
machine or on your Collab that you can use
